ISO 22000 certification in the Netherlands ensures that your company follows strict guidelines and best practices in food safety management.

If you sell food, you must earn the trust of your customers by preparing and transporting it safely from farm to table.

**Legislation Concerning Food Safety:**

The Netherlands enacted new food safety legislation in 2009, requiring businesses to use a Food Safety Management System (FSMS) to register it.

 Companies must have an FSMS that has been certified by a third-party agency to meet these standards.
 
What if your business lacks an ISO 22000:2005 or BRC-22000-certified FSMS? (certificate of business registration)

In that case, you must ensure that your facility complies with local laws and obtain both ISO-22000 and BRC certifications before beginning operations.

**A Food Safety Management System's Importance:**

Food safety is a top priority for both food producers and their customers, so food producers must be aware of two critical elements:

Customer concerns may arise as a result of the government's orders.

To be considered by regulatory bodies for product safety, a company must currently have an adequate Food Safety Management System (FSMS) that adheres to ISO 22000 Certification Standards. 

In other words, if something goes wrong, those who break the rules may face fines and penalties.

**What makes ISO 22000 unique?**

So, what exactly is it, and what makes it unique? To begin with, the Netherlands, as a country heavily reliant on food exports, has been at the forefront of the food safety management system (net agricultural exports account for approximately 25 per cent of total exports).

The country's highly educated workforce and progressive culture played a critical role in the country's rapid adoption of international standards.

As a result, the Netherlands quickly adopted ISO 22000 Certification to ensure that goods exported were safe and high-quality.

This early commitment was critical in establishing consistency across multiple businesses exporting food products from various companies worldwide, significantly contributing to recognition from more prominent business leaders worldwide.

**Is ISO 22000 certification required?**

The ISO 22000 Certification is one of the essential certifications you can obtain as a food business owner in the Netherlands.

It's also rather complicated, and you should know what it entails.
